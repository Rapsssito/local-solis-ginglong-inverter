## Installation

The easiest way, if you are using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/), is to install through HACS.

For manual installation, copy all the folders inside `custom_components/` and all of its contents into your Home Assistant's `custom_components` folder. This folder is usually inside your `/config` folder. If you are running Hass.io, use SAMBA to copy the folder over. If you are running Home Assistant Supervised, the `custom_components` folder might be located at `/usr/share/hassio/homeassistant`. You may need to create the `custom_components` folder and then copy the folders inside. After copying the folders, restart Home Assistant. You should see the integration in the integrations page.

This would not be possible without the great work published by [@planetmarshall](https://github.com/planetmarshall/solis-service) for reverse engineering the protocol ([link to the blog post](https://www.algodynamic.co.uk/reverse-engineering-the-solisginlong-inverter-protocol.html)).
